            <h1 class="mainHeading">History &amp; Origin</h1>
            <p class="info">
            History &amp; Origin Pyramid Spiritual Societies Movement (PSSM) was founded by enlightened master <b>Brahmarshi Patriji</b> in the year 1990 with the objective of spreading the message of spiritual and harmonious living and bringing its benefits within the easy reach of all humanity, without any barriers of class, religion or region. Starting from its humble beginning with “The Kurnool Spiritual Society” in 1990, the Pyramid Meditation Movement is now spreaded by 2,000 independent and autonomous Pyramid Spiritual Societies involving millions of active members and volunteers across all states in India and in several countries like New Zealand, Australia, USA, UK, Singapore, Malaysia, UAE, Vietnam, Mauritius and Sri Lanka. <br> <br>
                The Pyramid Spiritual Societies Movement is non-religious, non-cult, non-profit voluntary organization with the mission to spread Anapanasati Meditation, Vegetarianism and Pyramid Power to every one.
                <br><br>
                Dr. Gopala Krishna, is a medical doctor and he started his journey of spiritual science in search of happiness and the truth under the guidance of Brahmarshi Patriji and specially trained by grand master Paul Vijay Kumar . In this journey he got enlightened and realised that “Spiritual intellect is the root – physical health is the fruit”.  He started sharing the same with his patients who approached him for medical treatment.  As a part of this, he established spiritual health care centres and maintained them for ten years in different parts of India and offered eminent spiritual services as an adjuvant to qualified treatment with the help of senior masters who are well trained by him.
                <br><br>
                In the last 6 years, the group of spiritual counsellors and spiritual volunteers under the guidance of Dr Gopala Krishna has developed 350 spiritual tablets in the form of text, audio and audio visuals.  These Spiritual Concepts will change our internal belief system and help us to transform ourselves in order to open to the Universe for its guidance in all circumstances.  We conducted various training workshops which lead to the establishment of spiritual health care centres throughout India and abroad and trained 8,000 cases by teaching meditation, spiritual counselling, spiritual guidance and spiritual tablets.
                <br><br>
                Now we want to expand our services all over the world through offering franchise for establishing such centres.  For this we  established and registered a Non-Profit organisation which is structured from centre incharge to the CEO.

            <h3 class="mainHeading">Mode of Training at spiritual health care centres</h3>
            <p class="info">
            In this method, the persons with an ill-health are all considered as an ECW(Energy-Consciousness-Wisdom) units who are momentarily stagnated in unscientific belief systems. After an initial audio visual demo, they will be trained to meditate on ‘Natural breath observation’. The importance of vegetarian food, significance of pyramid power and spiritual science will be explained. They are allowed to  practice it  for a minimum of 40 days at their home or centre and during which there will be a follow-up. Periodically, they can avail the opportunity to participate in group meditation and spiritual sharing with  masters. They have to follow the spiritual advice given in the form of spiritual tablets during counseling which are available at libriares and spiritual health care centres. <br><br>
                
            After getting symptomatic relief by basic training , they are allowed to participate in Meditation classes to share their experiences. In due course of time, the patient should be examined by certified doctors(patient’s family doctors or by the organisation) and the medication will be regularized accordingly.In some cases, as part of training they need to learn fine arts like dance and music. <br><br>
                
            Similar to other medical practices of prescribing tablets, 350 SPIRITUAL TABLETS are prepared in Spiritual health system. It is the heart of the Spiritual Health Care Centres. These tablets(concepts) are easily understood and can be remembered by the patients for implementing in their daily life. They are available in the form of pamphlets, pocket books and audio/visuals. Prescribing these tablets as per the experience and requirement of patient is the main practice in Life health counseling. <br><br> 
                
            In many cases, it has been proved that any kind of health problem is due to ignorance and lack of spiritual knowledge. Through health counselling, it will be cured at the root-level and the patient will be made self-sufficient to attain complete health.<br><br>
